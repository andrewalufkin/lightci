- Utility functions for common test operations
- Robust test data fixtures

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. End-to-End Workflows
   - Add complete pipeline execution tests
   - Test integration between different components
   - Add real-world scenario tests
   - Test notification systems
   - Add performance benchmarks

2. Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
   - Add more boundary condition tests
   - Test rate limiting scenarios
   - Test concurrent access patterns
   - Add stress testing scenarios

### Medium Priority
1. Performance Testing
   - Add load testing scenarios
   - Implement response time benchmarks
   - Test database query optimization
   - Memory usage monitoring

2. Security Testing
   - Add penetration testing scenarios
   - Test authorization edge cases
   - Add CSRF protection tests
   - Test API rate limiting

## Notes
- Test coverage is now comprehensive across all major endpoints
- Recent updates have filled previous gaps in artifact and webhook testing
- All core functionality has dedicated test suites
- Test environment is well-structured with proper isolation
- Focus should now shift to end-to-end testing and performance optimization
- Consider adding more edge cases and stress testing scenarios
- Documentation of test cases is thorough and up-to-date
