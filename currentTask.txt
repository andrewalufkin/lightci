# Billing Service Implementation (Phase 2)

## Current Task
Implement core billing engine to track resource usage and manage user credits.

## Current Subtask
- Add artifact storage measurement (GB)
- Test that user history tracks artifact storage as well 

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Billing Service Structure**
   - Create new billing service file in services folder (done)

2. **Resource Usage Tracking**
   - Implement build minutes tracking for pipeline runs (done)
   - Add artifact storage measurement (GB)
   - Prepare deployment hours tracking framework
   - Design and implement usage history storage model

3. **Billing Calculations**
   - Create cost calculation functions for each resource type
   - Implement aggregate billing function for total user costs
   - Set up scheduled credit deduction process (hourly)

4. **Credit Management**
   - Implement credit balance validation before resource allocation
   - Create credit threshold detection and alerting system
   - Add usage prevention mechanisms for insufficient balances

5. **Testing & Integration**
   - Write unit tests for billing calculations
   - Create integration tests with pipeline runs
   - Test credit deduction and threshold scenarios
   - Integrate billing service with main application
   - Perform end-to-end testing

## Success Criteria
- Resource usage correctly tracked and stored
- Costs accurately calculated based on usage
- Credits properly deducted on schedule
- Users prevented from using resources with insufficient credits
- Low balance alerts triggered at appropriate thresholds
