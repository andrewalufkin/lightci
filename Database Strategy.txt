Database Strategy:
PostgreSQL serves as our primary database, chosen for its robust feature set and excellent scalability path. During development, we use a local PostgreSQL instance managed via Docker, while production deployments will utilize managed PostgreSQL services (e.g., AWS RDS).
Key Components:

Prisma ORM:

Provides type-safe database queries
Handles schema migrations
Generates TypeScript types from schema
Supports both development and production environments


Schema Design:

Normalized structure for Pipelines, Builds, and Artifacts
JSONB storage for flexible pipeline configurations
Strong referential integrity between related entities
Efficient indexing for common query patterns


Development Setup:

Local PostgreSQL via Docker Compose
Development database seeding and migration tools
Environment-based configuration
Health check and monitoring capabilities


Production Readiness:

Seamless transition to cloud-hosted databases
Connection pooling and optimization
Environment-based configuration
Backup and recovery strategies



The database architecture prioritizes developer experience during the development phase while maintaining a clear path to production deployment, ensuring that no significant architectural changes are needed when moving to a production environment.
